# top-down-game-prototype
my first try making big game in c++ and sfml, unfortunatly not finished, just laveing source code here for anyone to use if needed

## some featchures 
in prototype provided classes for entities, and different types of them (enemy, player). Component system witch allows us to put component on any object in game we want.
Implemented animation component for creating animations from spritesheet, movement component, hitbox component and so on.

Almost working editor which allows us to create levels easylly, map is written to .tlm file and tileset in .tls file.  


Also there are some shaders for light from player or light from any other object.  

Weapon system with fight component are implemented but there are no attack animations for current character.
