        enemies generation depending on percent of spawn and list of able enemies in levels
        boss class and different boss behaviour

fight system idea:
    in fight enemy can attack you and you can attack enemy
    you can make dash or block in timing to dodge damage
    depending on enemy's stan resistance it will take one or some hits to stan enemy while attacking
    however on any your hit enemy can put block (chance is based on player and enemy power ratio)
    and you also can block attack in timing to make same attack on enemy as in sentence lower
    if enemy blocks your attack it makes counterattack (cannot be stopped) which will have bigger damage and chance of causing negative effects (can be dodged)
    negative effects are such as (default): bleeding, broken arm/leg, (depending on enemy type): poison, burning etc
    negative effects can be stopped by different ways however if enemy is powerful enough and chance will be perfect, it can CUT YOU arm/leg
    this kind of debaff is very bad and cannot be fixed by usual, however you can find metal arm or leg and put it (you will need highest rank doctor)
    you cant carry weapon in hand, you dont have and if you lost one leg, you will move much slower and wouldnt be able to do dashes
    loosing two legs or arms will make game almost impossible however almost doesnt mean absolute impossible
